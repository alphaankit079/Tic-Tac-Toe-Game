## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **HTML5** – Game structure  
- **CSS3** – Styling and responsive layout  
- **JavaScript** – Game logic and interactivity  
- **Google Fonts** – Custom typography  
- **Audio** – Sound effects (music, ting, gameover)

## 📂 File Structure

```
├── index.html        # Main HTML file
├── styles.css        # All styles and responsive design
├── script.js         # Game logic
├── music.mp3         # Background music (optional)
├── ting.mp3          # Move sound effect
├── gameover.mp3      # Game over sound effect
├── excited.gif       # Winning animation
└── screenshot.png    # (Optional) Preview image
```

## 🧠 How It Works

- Each box is clickable and alternates between 'X' and 'O'
- The game checks for winning conditions after every move
- If a player wins, a line is drawn across the winning row/column/diagonal
- A reset button clears the board and resets the game state
